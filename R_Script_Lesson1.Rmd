```

Welcome to coding in R! Coding is intimidating at first, but each one of you can do this! 

First, we're going to explore a few functions in R. If a line of code is us telling the computer what to do, a function is a saved command we can use over and over. If we want to know what a function can do, we can type a ? before the function. 

# What Functions can Do
```{r}
?dput
?sapply 
?grep
?args
```

# A Game in R: using a function  
```{r}
# Number Guessing Game in R

# Function to start the game
start_game <- function() {
  # Generate a random number between 1 and 100
  target_number <- sample(1:100, 1)
  
  # Initialize the number of attempts
  attempts <- 0
  
  # Print welcome message
  cat("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\n")
  cat("I have chosen a number between 1 and 100. Can you guess it?\n")
  
  # Loop until the user guesses the correct number
  repeat {
    # Prompt the user for a guess
    guess <- as.integer(readline(prompt = "Enter your guess: "))
    
    # Increment the number of attempts
    attempts <- attempts + 1
    
    # Check the user's guess
    if (guess < target_number) {
      cat("Too low! Try again.\n")
    } else if (guess > target_number) {
      cat("Too high! Try again.\n")
    } else {
      cat("Congratulations! You guessed the number in", attempts, "attempts.\n")
      break
    }
  }
}

# R as a calculator 

```{r}
x <- 374*567
print(x)
```
# Make all the same changes to a data set 
A vector with everyone's height (in inches)
What if everyone was 10% thei size 
```{r}
height <- c()
mini_height <- 
```


# Making a table 
```{r}
#ages <- sort(c(#insert our data))
#feet <- c(#insert our data) 
data <- 
```

# Graphing our data
x and y: the coordinates of points to plot

type : the type of graph to create; Possible values are :
type=“p”: for points (by default)
type=“l”: for lines
type=“b”: for both; points are connected by a line
type=“o”: for both ‘overplotted’;
type=“h”: for ‘histogram’ like vertical lines
type=“s”: for stair steps
type=“n”: for no plotting

```{r}
plot(x=data$ages, y = data$feet, type= "o")
```

# Data in Base R 
Link to data sets:  https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/00Index.html

## Warpbreaks data set 
First let's explore the data 
```{r}
View(warpbreaks)
```
Question 1: does tension affect the number of warp breaks? 
```{r}
plot(x= warpbreaks$tension, y = warpbreaks$breaks)
```
Question from the class! 
```{r}

```

## Iris data set 

```{r}
species <- as.factor(iris$Species)
lengths <- iris$Sepal.Length

plot(species, lengths)
```

# Making Graphisc more pretty 
graph set up 

```{r}
x <- 1:100
y <- (rnorm(100, sd = 15) + x + 100) / 10
group <- c(rep("A", 50), rep("B", 50))

```

A base R plot 
```{r}
plot(x,y)
```

A prettier plot in Base R 
```{r}
k_purple <- "#875692"
k_orange <- "#F38400"
colors <- c(A = k_purple, B = k_orange)


plot (x, y, 
      bty = "n", # remove box
      pch = 20,
      cex = 1.4,
      col = colors[group]
      )
```
